This is my custom program for COS20007 (Object-Oriented Programming) unit in my third semester of my first year at Swinburne Vietnam. The program was made with C# and utilizes the .NET framework to handle audio I/O and digital processing. 

Alphtech DSP is a real-time digital audio processing application that functions as a virtual guitar amplifier and multi-effects processor. It simulates a guitar amplifier with a digital signal processing chain that handles live audio input with minimal latency. The application allows users to shape their sound through adjustable amplifier controls such as volume, gain, and a 3-band EQ (treble, mid, bass), while also applying a range of built-in audio effects including delay, chorus, tremolo, overdrive, and distortion. In addition, Alphtech DSP supports recording of processed audio, playback of backing tracks alongside live input, and the use of preloaded guitarist amp presets, as well as saving and loading custom presets.
